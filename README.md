README
===========================
This project is mainly based on some commonly used recommended methods, as well as reference to other projects,
and on the basis of these to improve, the project uses python and some open source library development.The main
methods include content-based, collaborative filtering, association rules, matrix decomposition and so on.
The experimental data will come from movielens, ml-100k.
